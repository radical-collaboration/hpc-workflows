This directory contains files for reading 3D attenuation model QRFSI12, developed by Colleen Dalton, Goran Ekstrom and Adam Dziewonski.

The model is obtained from fundamental mode Rayleigh wave amplitudes and the data are corrected for Focusing, Source and Instrument effects.  It is a degree 12 spherical harmonic model horizontally with 8 cubic B splines in the radial direction.  It includes a 1D reference model (ref_QRFSI12: columns are depth and 1/Qmu) defined in the whole mantle, and a 3D perturbation model QRFSI12.dat defined at depths between 24.4 km and 650km (read by attenuation_model_QRFSI12.f90 in trunk directory).
